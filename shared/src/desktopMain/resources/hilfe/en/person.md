# Person sheet and editing

The person sheet opens with a **double-click** on a person, with **Ctrl+E** or via the **Edit** icon. It shows everything about a person and is also the place for editing.

## Layout

Name, dates and picture on top. Below, the tabs:

- **Data:** all events as a table (event, date, place / description), plus age at death.
- **Life:** the timeline with marriage, births of the children and the age at each event. It also lists the events where the person was a godparent or witness (“Godmother at: Christening of …”); a click leads to the child or the couple.
- **Godparents and witnesses:** below baptism and marriage a line “Godparents:” or “Witnesses:” appears – in the timeline, in the detail area of the data table, in the family view and on index cards. Godparents with their own record are underlined and clickable, those without (from a note “Paten: …” or the GEDCOM-L field _GODP) appear as text. ⓘ unfolds a note about the godparent, the source icon opens the source. Living godparents you are not allowed to see show only as “Private”. Below the data table the section **Godparent and witness roles** lists all baptisms and marriages where the person was a godparent or witness; a click on the heading folds it away. Both need api4webtrees 1.11 or newer; with an older module the godparent note simply stays a note.
- **Type of marriage:** civil and religious marriage appear as separate events with their type; lists and the check use the civil one when both exist.
- **Parents/Siblings**: parents and siblings, including half-siblings. A click switches to that person.
- **Partners/Children**: the partnerships on the left, the children of the selected one on the right, below its events (marriage, divorce, residence …) to add, edit and delete. Double-click a partner or child to show their sheet; **+** adds a partner or a child of this partnership.
- **Name**: given names, surname and name suffix have their own fields when editing.
- **Simple / Full** (bottom of the sheet): “Simple” shows a form in the Data tab with name, birth, baptism, religion, occupation, marriage per partnership, death and burial to type into directly; “Full” shows the table of all events with age and markers for note and source (click a column header to sort).
  Only what you changed is saved; sources, notes and other details of the event are kept. If an event exists more than once, the form edits the first. A date the program cannot interpret (“spring 1850”) is saved as date text. Saving happens when you leave a field (Tab or click elsewhere), as everywhere in the program. An invalid date stays red and is not sent until you correct it or choose “Save as text anyway”; only then does closing or quitting ask first.
- **Notes**, **Sources**, **Media**.
- **Map:** the places of life as a list with links to OpenStreetMap.

## Paging

**Page Up** and **Page Down** move to the previous or next person in the list, **Ctrl+Home** and **Ctrl+End** to the first and last. **Esc** closes the window.

## Editing

Editing needs edit rights in webtrees. Changes go to webtrees immediately; depending on the tree's settings they apply at once or wait for a moderator's approval.

- **Change an event:** double-click the row (or Edit). Date and place are selected, not typed: exact, about, before, after, between; day, month, year. Places are suggested from the tree as you type.
- **Add event**, including family events such as marriage.
- **Add relative** (Ctrl+N): create parents, partner, child or sibling with name and first events. In the navigator this is also in the right-click menu.
- **Entering godparents and witnesses:** select the baptism or marriage in the data table and click **Edit godparents …** or **Edit witnesses …** in the detail area below (marriages also in the Partners/Children tab). Arrange the list with the arrows, ✕ removes an entry. **Person from the tree …** searches by name and links the person; **Without a record …** adds someone who has no entry of their own – as written in the church register: “Friedrich Plate, farmer at Celle”. The role (godparent, witness or another such as “midwife”) and a note about the person are below the list. Linked godparents are stored as webtrees does, people without a record as the GEDCOM-L fields _GODP and _WITN; sources on a godparent are kept. Godparents recorded only at the person (older exports) are moved into the baptism with a tick. Needs api4webtrees 1.12 or newer.
- **Type of marriage:** in the event dialog of a marriage, **Type** chooses between not stated, civil, religious, registered partnership and common-law. A second ceremony (such as the religious one after the civil one) is added as another “Marriage” event of the partnership.
- **Delete:** an event or the whole person, after confirmation.
- **Notes and media:** In the **Notes** tab you add general notes about the person (**+ New note**), change and delete them; notes on events are listed below for reading. In the **Media** tab you attach photos and scans (a file, an existing media object, one from the archive or simply dragged from the file manager), change title and type and remove links; a click on a picture opens it. Needs api4webtrees with API level 23.
- **Edit in webtrees:** everything the program cannot do itself (such as shared note records) you do on the person page in the browser. See [webtrees in the browser](hilfe:webtrees).

## Merging individuals

Duplicate individuals arise when two files are combined or while entering data – the same ancestor twice, once as a child and once as a husband. **Individual › Merge individuals …** (tree managers only, needs api4webtrees 1.16 or newer) lists all pairs the plausibility check takes for duplicates: same name and one identical event date (rule 219) or a similar name with a close year of birth (rule 228). In the check the same pairs show a symbol with two merging lines. **Add pair …** takes any two individuals, such as children with the same name and no data; in the table of individuals the right mouse button does the same.

**Merge …** shows both individuals side by side with all their events. The first stays, the second is absorbed into it. Ticked is everything of the first and from the second only what the first does not have word for word; a “deceased” without a date gives way to a death with a date. Links to families and media always stay, sources and notes at the events too. Everything that pointed to the second individual – families, source citations, godparent roles – points to the first afterwards. Below, the program suggests further pairs (father, mother, spouses and children with the same name); ticked ones follow after the merge. If an individual ends up with two births because the data contradict each other, the check shows it and you clean it up in the individual sheet.

**Undo:** every merge is listed in the **Log** tab with time and user. **Undo** restores both individuals and all links as they were – even days later, as long as nobody has edited the affected records since; otherwise the program names the changed records and leaves everything as it is. Without automatic acceptance, merging and undoing wait for a moderator like any change.

## Photos

**Add photo** picks a file from the PC and attaches it to the person; the picture is scaled to the server's upload limit. A click on a picture opens the viewer.

## Printing and sharing

- **File › Print person sheet …** (Ctrl+P) and **Person sheet as PDF …**
- **Person › Copy person text** (Ctrl+Shift+C) puts all details as text on the clipboard, e.g. for an e-mail or a word processor.
- More output: [Lists](hilfe:listen) (person sheet as a list), [Charts](hilfe:tafeln), [Books](hilfe:buecher).
